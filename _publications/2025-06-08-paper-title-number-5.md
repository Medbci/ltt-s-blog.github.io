Electroencephalography (EEG) shows strong potential for detecting physiological biomarkers of consciousness,
and brain network analysis serves as an effective technique. Therefore, a robust approach to brain network
construction is of great significance. The convergent cross mapping (CCM) is a powerful tool for capturing the
coupling relationship between two signals. However, a major drawback of CCM is its sensitivity to noise. To
address this problem, we proposed a symbolic method that combines fuzzy membership functions called fuzzy
symbolic convergent cross mapping (FuzzSCCM). Through the simulation results, we verified its robustness to
noise, sensitivity to coupling, and data length. Building on this coupling measure, we constructed EEG brain
networks and validated the approach on real DOC EEG datasets.
